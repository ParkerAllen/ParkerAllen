  Currently I am a Eastern Michigan University Computer Science student. My main hobbies are making and playing video games by myself and in a college club (<a href=https://sgwdev.org/" target="_blank">sgwdev.org</a>).

  I love making things.The journey of working on something for a long period of time, switching between making small adjustments and pulling your hair out trying to figure out what went wrong, is a hard fought journey but the emotions that come with finishing the project are much sweeter.
