  I love making things.The journey of working on something for a long period of time, switching between making small adjustments and pulling your hair out trying to figure out what went wrong, is a hard fought journey but the emotions that come with finishing the project are much sweeter. Using what I created and showing others is an amazing feeling of pride and refreshment, and learning something new just fills me with satisfaction and drive to learn something else.

  Currently I am a Eastern Michigan University Computer Science student. My main hobbies are making and playing video games by myself and in a college club (https://sgwdev.org/).
