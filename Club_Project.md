### 2D Platformer(Club has horrible naming sense)

**The Game:** This game is supposed to be a 2D platformer RPG similar to Metroid made with Unity in C#. There are about 10 people working on a seperate part of the game.

**My Role:** For this project I am in charge of most of the art assets, enemy movement, pathfinding and enemy design. An unexpected part of my role was making the enemies easily interact with the other peoples script. You can find some code for it [here](https://github.com/ParkerAllen/VariousCodeProjects){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
