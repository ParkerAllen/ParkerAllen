### Polymorph 
**The Game:** 2d puzzle platformer that has 10 different levels. 
This was a 4 person group project for a class. Finished May 2020.

**My Role** My role in this project was mainly art assets, created a 3 levels and did touch up work on the other levels.
I was also the main playtester and fixed a few of the bugs I found.
